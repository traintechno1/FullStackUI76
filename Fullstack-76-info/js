                                    Javascript
                    
                - JS is a scripting language
                - We can add a logic to the web pages with the help of JS.
                - JS is a JIT(Just in time) language.
                - JS file has a file extention as .js
                - It can also be embeded in .html file with <script></script> tag.





                                    Variable:
        -- (Vari + able)-> Ability to change the value of the container.
        -- Variable is a container which can store a value.


        There are basically 3 keywords using which we can create a variable:
            - var
            - let
            - const

        Variable Declaration (Creating a variable):
            var variable_name;





                                "Dipika"


                                "Havells"

                                brand = "havells", 
                                brand = "Samsung"




        Operators:


        Type of Operators:

        1) Arithmetic Operators:

            i) Addition (+): 
                - it requires two operands to add them.

                a + b


            ii) Subsctraction (-): 
                - it requires two operands to subtract them.

                a - b
            iii) Multiplication (*): 
                - it requires two operands to multiply them.

                a * b
            iv) Division (/): 
                - it requires two operands to divide them.

                a / b



            Logical Operators:

            i) Logical AND(&&):

            a      b       result
          true    true     true
          true    false    false
          false   true     false
          false   false    false

          -- When all the values are true then only we have result as true,
          -- even single value is false result of and is false.

            ii) Logical OR (||):

        a         b         result
        true    true        true
        true    false       true
        false   true        true
        false   false       false

            -- when all the values are false then the result is false,
            -- even a single value is true the result is true in OR.


            iii) Logical NOT (!):

            a           result
            true        false
            false       true


        
        Pre Increment 
        ++value;

        -- In Pre Increment first the value gets changed and then used

        Post Increment
        value++;

        -- In Post Increment first the value gets used and then changed.




        Conditional Statements:

        Condition is nothing but based on some scenario perform certain task.

        if(condition){

        }
        else{

        }



        if(condition){

        }else if(condition){

        }else if(condition){

        }else{

        }


        Switch Case:

        it is similar to else if ladder, but it is more cleaner way of writing else if ladder.


        switch(value){
            case 1:

            case 2:

            case 3:

            case 4:


        }


        Loop:

        for(initialise; check the condition; increment/decrement){

        }        



        Function:

        function is a piece of code that we write once and reuse as many times as we want.


        function function_name(){

        }

        second way of function creation:

        Arrow Function->

        let fuction_name = () => {

        }


        Array:

        let a1 = 100;
        let a2 = 200;
        let a3 = 300;
        let a4 = 400;
        let a5 = 500;
        let a6 = 600;
        let a7 = 700;

        let a = [ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 ]; //this is an array


        Object:

    - Object in JS is collection of key and value pairs, where key represents what data is present, 
    and value is the actual value

    to create an object we use {}.

    ex:
    let obj = {
        first_name: '',
        last_name: '',
    }
